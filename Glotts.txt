Please translate the English words in the EnglishWord column to Persian.
The translations should be the most accurate meaning based on the category codes, and should be a single word or phrase, without including any synonyms. 
Translate it casually, in a natural Persian vibe—no stiff word-for-word crap.
Translate exactly per the database—English words must match with WordID in it.
In the last column, romanize the word to Latin script.
In the translation, a comma should not be used.
